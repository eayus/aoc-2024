# Advent of Code 2024

Solutions for advent of code I wrote in Haskell (and Python when I thought it would be easier...). I'm not bothering to tidy up the solutions after I get the correct answer, so they might be a bit ugly, but it's representative of how I actually solved the problems.

To run the solutions, run `nix-shell` in the root directory to start a shell with all required dependencies. Then just use `runhaskell` to run each solution. The solutions will look for the input in a file called `input.txt`.
